# Max Sink Area

## Problem Description
Given an M * N matrix, where matrix[i][j] is the height of the block on position (i, j). Each block has 4 neighbors - the blocks at its top, bottom, left and right.
A sink area is a group of neighboring blocks that are fully surrounded by other blocks with greater heights. When water is poured onto the matrix, the sink area traps the water in it. Build a function that finds the number of blocks in the maximum sink area.
